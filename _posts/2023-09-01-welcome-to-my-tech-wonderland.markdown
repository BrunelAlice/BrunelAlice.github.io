# The Webderland Odyssey

## Fighting the development fatigue

Welcome to "Alice in Webderland", where the world of web development unfolds with passion, curiosity, and a touch of whimsy. This blog is a chronicle of my journey, where I will share inspirations about coding with anyone who wants to join the tech-adventure and needs a little bit of light.

Being the first to feel the coding pressure, the dev impostor syndrom and the programming fatigue, I thought I would focus my energy on sharing the good and the bad of the journey, to let people know that they are not alone. Lately, the motivation has not been great: I couldn't help but focus on everything I am lacking, or on the fact that I am not good enough compared to others, the fact that I feel slow and unworthy. I have loved coding for so long, it would be a shame to give up just because of external contexts where we are pressured to compare ourself with each others, while the goal of it all is just to code, enjoy it and do it well.

## Why blogging?

I am not sure where this blog will take me, but it will be a way to keep me connected and focused on the passion. I would like to share about my journey, my small and big challenges, because maybe someone will relate to it one day, who knows. I could work on a portfolio, on creating other projects, but for the moment I don't have that kind of inspiration since I am quite tired, at so many level. You know how talking about something - or someone - you love sometimes makes you fall in love with it again? Well, that is what I am aiming for, to keep the light alive in a somewhat not so shiny environment.

**I hope that you will like to follow along, and do not hesitate to reach out! I would love to speak with other inspired developers looking to make this path a bright and fun one.**
