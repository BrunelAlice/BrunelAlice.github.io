# Why I Chose to Take Harvard's Free CS50 Course üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´

You may have heard of it already, Harvard's free CS50 course is an online offering from Harvard University designed to provide a solid foundation in Computer Science.

It is renowned for its quality and breadth, delivering the same learning experience as Harvard's own students. The course covers essential topics like algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. It is a great opportunity for developers who haven't ventured into the world of Computer Science (like me) to gain robust programming skills and get acquainted with industry best practices.

Indeed, the CS50 course is open to everyone, regardless of their programming skill level, and it offers a unique chance to learn from renowned experts.

## Why I Chose to Pursue this Course

While I have completed a bootcamp, which is undoubtedly a shortcut to landing a job in the development and programming field, I clearly sense that I could have dived deeper in some subjects. During my bootcamp, we covered fundamental concepts, but I'm well aware that there are others that would give me more clarity, even if they don't immediately impact my day-to-day job - for the moment at least.

Also, the CS50 course provides access to the expertise of David J. Malan, an excellent teacher and educator. His passion for the subject is infectious, making the course very engaging despite the sometimes abstract nature of the topics. I think it is a real chance to be able to "attend" his classes and I wouldn't want to miss that. I personally value both practical and scholar knowledges, and I think this can give a different view on a field that is currently highly marketised.

## Challenging Oneself... or Preparing?

In the world of development, it's often said that one should stay updated and keep learning continuously. In my case, if I choose to invest time in this course instead of learning another framework, it's mainly because I want to keep the developer spark alive.

First, I believe that with a solid foundation, I can be more confident and overcome imposter syndrome - or at least live with it. The world of development is so big, I tend to feel pressured into learning as much as I can, but looking ahead to a crowded learning path is a bit demoralising for me. By following the course, I can move forward step by step, with curiosity instead of fear.

## How It Will Be Presented on the Blog

I've decided to document my progress on the blog and convey my understanding of the topics covered. It will also serve as a means to keep my notes in memory, delve into more complicated subjects and structure my thoughts.

I can't guarantee that it will be exhaustive, but I hope to provide an overview for anyone interested in the course. üôèüèΩ
